# COMP 333 - Assignment 5: Recursion and Structures in Prolog

**Course Title:** Concepts of Programming Languages<br/>
**Semester:** Summer 2021<br/>
**Due:** Friday, August 27 at 11:59 PM<br/>

## Goals for This Assignment

By the time you have completed this work, you should be able to:

* Use arithmetic in Prolog
* Define recursive rules in Prolog
* Use structures in Prolog

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Read Chapters 6, 8-9 of the _Amzi! Adventure in Prolog Tutorial_

Read chapters 6, 8-9 of the [_Amzi! Adventure in Prolog Tutorial_](http://www.amzi.com/AdventureInProlog/index.php). Links to the individual chapters are on the left side of the screen.

### Step 2: Complete Related Exercises

Exercises for chapters 6, 8-9 are provided in the following files:

* [`6_exercises.pl`](src/6_exercises.pl)
* [`8_exercises.pl`](src/8_exercises.pl)
* [`9_exercises.pl`](src/9_exercises.pl)

You must complete all of the above exercises. It is recommended to first read a chapter, then complete the exercises for that chapter, as opposed to trying to read in bulk and then complete the exercises in bulk.

### Step 3: Turn in Your Code

You need to upload the following files:

* `6_exercises.pl`
* `8_exercises.pl`
* `9_exercises.pl`

In addition, if you collaborated with anyone else, be sure to create a `collaborators.txt` file and write the names of the people you collaborated with in the file, one per line. Please submit this file along with the other files.

You can turn in the assignment multiple times, but only the last version you submitted will be graded.
